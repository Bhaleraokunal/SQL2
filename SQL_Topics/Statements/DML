DML ( Data Manipulation language)
	1) UPDATE 
		Syntax :
			UPDATE  TABLE_NAME
			SET COL_NAME = VALUE
			WHERE  <CONDITION>
			WHERE  <CONDITION>
		Example:
			UPDATE   EMP
			SET  SAL = SAL*110/100
			WHERE   DEPTNO = 10;
Q1)  WAQ  TO UPDATE THE COMMISSION TO 1000 IF THEY ARE NUL 
	UPDATE EMP
	SET NUL(COMM,0);
Q2) WAQ TO UPDATE THE COMMISSION 200 IF THE EMPLOYEE ARE WOROKING IN NEW YORK?
	UPDATE EMP
	SET COMM = COMM + 200
	WHERE DEPTNO IN (SELECT DEPTNO
				FROM DEPT
				WHERE LOC = ‘NEW YORK’);
Q3) WAQ TO UPDATE THE EMPLOYEE SALARY TO 20% INCREMENT IF THEY ARE REPORTING TO BLACK?
Q4) WAQ TO UPDATE FOR TOP TWO EMPLOYEE BASED ON SALARY 10% INCREMENT?

•	DELETE :
o	Syntax:
	From TABLE
WHERE CONDITION;
Q1) DELETE THE CHICAGO LOC FROM THE EMPLOYEE TABLE ?
	DELETE
	FROM EMP
	WHERE DEPTNO = ( SELECT DEPTNO
				FROM DEPT
				WHERE LOC = ‘CHICAGO’);
•	TRANSECTION :
•	ROLLBACK : 
	"ROLLBACK is used to reverse accidental UPDATE or DELETE operations, but only if they were not committed yet."
•	COMMIT : 
	COMMIT is a SQL command used to permanently save all changes made during the current transaction into the database.

•	SAVEPOINT : 
	SAVEPOINT is a command that lets you set a point within a transaction to which you can roll back without undoing the entire transaction, before the commit.
•	Example :
	Savepoint s1
	Rollback to s1;
•	CASE :

1)
SELECT ENAME, SAL,
  CASE 
    WHEN TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'D') IN ('2','4','6') THEN
      '*' || SUBSTR(ENAME, 2, LENGTH(ENAME) - 1) || '*'
    WHEN TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'D') IN ('3','5','7') THEN
      SUBSTR(ENAME, 1, 1) || '*' ||
      SUBSTR(ENAME, 3, LENGTH(ENAME) - 2) || '*' ||
      SUBSTR(ENAME, LENGTH(ENAME), 1)
    ELSE 'NULL'
  END AS MODIFIED_NAME
FROM EMP;
2)
	SELECT ENAME,SAL
	CASE
		WHEN SAL < 2000 THEN ‘WORST SAL’
		WHEN SAL > 2000 THEN ‘BEST SAL’
	ELSE ‘NULL’
	END
	FROM EMP;

3) IF THE NAME IS EVEN THEN *-----* AND IF THE NAME IS ODD THEN -*----*-
	SELECT ENAME,
       CASE
         WHEN LENGTH(ENAME) % 2 = 0 THEN REPLACE(ENAME, SUBSTR(ENAME, 1, 1), '*')
         WHEN LENGTH(ENAME) % 2 != 0 THEN REPLACE(ENAME, SUBSTR(ENAME, -1), '*')
         ELSE 'NULL'
       END AS MODIFIED_NAME
FROM EMP;
	USIND MODE 
•	SELECT ENAME,
•	       CASE
•	         WHEN MOD(LENGTH(ENAME), 2) = 0 THEN REPLACE(ENAME, SUBSTR(ENAME, 1, 1), '*')
•	         WHEN MOD(LENGTH(ENAME), 2) = 1 THEN REPLACE(ENAME, SUBSTR(ENAME, -1), '*')
•	         ELSE 'NULL'
•	       END AS MODIFIED_NAME
•	FROM EMP;
